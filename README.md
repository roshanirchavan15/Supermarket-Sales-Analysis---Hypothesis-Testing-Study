A marketing research organization wants to examine the costs charged by two grocery chains: Miller's and Albert's. Using a standardized one-week shopping plan (grocery list), the study firm purchases identical items from 50 stores in each chain. Each chain's stores are chosen at random, and all purchases take place over the course of one week.

Are there any statistically difference on mean weekly expenses between two supermarket chains?

Steps:

1. Randomly select sample data (15 weekly expenses for each supermarket chain) 

2. Descriptive statistics 

3. Performance hypothesis testing 

-State null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis

-Specify the level of significance (alpha, the probability of Type I error)

-Select the test statistic

-State decision rule
